## Project Description

This repository contains a front-end Amazon clone built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This project was created as a practical exercise to solidify my understanding of core web development concepts, particularly DOM manipulation, event handling, and responsive design. It demonstrates my ability to structure a complex web page and implement dynamic features.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML:** For structuring the web page.
* **CSS:** For styling and layout.
* **JavaScript:** For interactivity and dynamic functionality.

## Key Features Implemented

* Dynamic product display.
* Basic product listing and layout.

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Habibullah-Hisam/Amazon-Clone-JS-Project.git](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/Habibullah-Hisam/Amazon-Clone-JS-Project.git)
    ```

2.  Navigate to the project directory:
